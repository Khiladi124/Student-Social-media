The project's goal is to establish virtual connections between people all over the world. With merely a mouse click, the user can get in touch with anyone.

This program doesn't have GUI and runs on a terminal. It still has a lot of features and a very user-friendly terminal interface.

This program will provide the following things:
an option for new users to register, and for returning users to log in.
to use the application to look up your friends and see if they are also here.
to adhere to your pals who have accounts on the app.
to message each other amongst your friends.
If the user adheres to them, they can view any person's entire set of details. Any user can easily access and use the program to its full potential thanks to the project.
